# Problem Statement: Inferential Statistics Practice Exercise

## Overview
This exercise provides a comprehensive practice in applying various probability distributions and statistical inference techniques to solve real-world problems. Students will work with binomial, uniform, and normal distributions, as well as sampling distributions, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing.

## Objectives
1. Apply binomial distribution to solve quality control and probability problems
2. Analyze uniform distribution using real-world time data
3. Utilize normal distribution for various probability calculations
4. Understand sampling distributions and their applications
5. Construct confidence intervals for population parameters
6. Formulate and test hypotheses using statistical methods

## Dataset
The exercise includes a dataset (`assignment.csv`) containing student IDs and the time taken (in hours) to complete a statistics assignment. This dataset is used to:
- Identify and plot the probability distribution
- Calculate probabilities using uniform distribution properties
- Answer questions about student completion times

## Topics Covered

### 1. Binomial Distribution
- Quality control scenarios (LED bulb manufacturing)
- Sports statistics (NBA free throw conversion)
- Employee performance ratings (multinomial scenarios)

### 2. Uniform Distribution
- Analysis of assignment completion times
- Probability calculations for continuous uniform variables
- Visualization of uniform probability density functions

### 3. Normal Distribution
- Telecommunication billing analysis
- Manufacturing quality control (bottle filling)
- Probability calculations for normally distributed variables
- Percentile and quantile calculations

### 4. Sampling Distribution
- Application of the Central Limit Theorem
- Probability calculations for sample means

### 5. Interval Estimation
- Construction of confidence intervals
- Interpretation of confidence levels

### 6. Hypothesis Testing
- Formulation of null and alternative hypotheses
- Calculation and interpretation of p-values

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion, students will be able to:
- Select appropriate probability distributions for different scenarios
- Calculate probabilities using Python's statistical libraries
- Visualize probability distributions
- Apply statistical inference techniques to make data-driven decisions
- Interpret results in the context of real-world problems
