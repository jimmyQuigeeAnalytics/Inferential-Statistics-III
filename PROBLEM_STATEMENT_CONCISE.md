# Problem Statement

This practice exercise applies inferential statistics concepts to solve real-world probability and statistical inference problems. Using Python and statistical libraries, students will:

1. **Binomial Distribution**: Calculate probabilities for quality control (LED bulbs), sports statistics (NBA free throws), and employee ratings scenarios.

2. **Uniform Distribution**: Analyze student assignment completion times from `assignment.csv` to identify the distribution, plot it, and calculate probabilities for various time intervals.

3. **Normal Distribution**: Solve probability problems involving cell phone bills, bottle filling operations, and manufacturing quality control using normal distribution properties.

4. **Sampling Distribution**: Apply the Central Limit Theorem to calculate probabilities for sample means.

5. **Interval Estimation**: Construct 95% confidence intervals for population means when population standard deviation is known.

6. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate null and alternative hypotheses and calculate p-values for two-tailed tests.

The exercise uses the `assignment.csv` dataset containing student IDs and completion times (in hours) to demonstrate uniform distribution analysis and probability calculations.
